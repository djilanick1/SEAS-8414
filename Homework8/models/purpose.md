The model files are generated by running the train_model.py script, which automates the process of creating a dataset, training a machine learning model, and saving the output files to a designated directory.

This script uses the PyCaret library to handle the entire machine learning workflow, including data generation, model comparison, and saving the final model and a feature importance plot.

How to Run the Script
- Save the Code: Save the code above into a file named updated_train_model.py in your project's app/ directory.

- Execute the Script: Open your terminal and navigate to the app/ directory. Run the script using the following command:


    ```bash
python updated_train_model.py
    ```
    
Check the Output: After the script finishes running, you should find two new files in a newly created models/ subdirectory inside your app/ folder:

=> phishing_url_detector.pkl (This is your saved model).

=> feature_importance.png (This is the plot showing feature importance).

These are the files that your Streamlit application will load when it runs.
